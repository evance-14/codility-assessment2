# pseudocode
1.Split the string into an array of integers
2.Sort the array 
3.Loop through each element in the array using each_with_index ,(|element,index|)
4.Check if the element is not equal to the expected number in the sequence
    <!-- if element != index +1
    # return missing no
     return index + 1
    end
    return 0 -->

## Challenge 1: Broken Sequence
You receive some random elements as a space-delimited string. Check if the elements are part of an ascending sequence of integers starting with 1, with an increment of 1 (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4).

Return:

- 0 if the elements can form such a sequence, and no number is missing ("not broken", e.g. "1 2 4 3")
- 1 if there are any non-numeric elements in the input ("invalid", e.g. "1 2 a")
- n if the elements are part of such a sequence, but some numbers are missing, and n is the lowest of them ("broken", e.g. "1 2 4" or "1 5")
Examples
"1 2 3 4"  ==>  return 0, because the sequence is complete

"1 2 4 3"  ==>  return 0, because the sequence is complete (order doesn't matter)

"2 1 3 a"  ==>  return 1, because it contains a non numerical character

"1 3 2 5"  ==>  return 4, because 4 is missing from the sequence

"1 5"      ==>  return 2, because the sequence is missing 2, 3, 4 and 2 is the lowest

 

## Challenge 2: Find out whether the shape is a cube
To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side! It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer
